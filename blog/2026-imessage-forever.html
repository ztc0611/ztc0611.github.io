<p>From 2007-2014, the default and only retention option for iPhone texts was "Forever." This changed with iOS 8, released September 2014.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> At that point the automatic cleanup options were functionally 30 days, 1 year, or 7 years.</p>

<p>Today, this option is 30 days, 1 year, or 18.5 years. Since 2014, photos have gotten a lot larger, as have videos. iMessage will perform <em>some</em> size mitigation depending on context<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>, however it doesn't touch standard HEIC/JPEG images.</p>

<p>The iPhone (2007, "2G") took photos between 400 and 800KB, and at launch didn't even support MMS.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup> A modern standard iPhone photo is frequently in the 3-6MB range. Across that time, directly sharing pictures also moved from being the realm of email/flash drives/DVDs to the realm of texting.</p>

<p>iMessage itself had only existed for 3 years in 2014, any messages before that were only "green bubble" SMS/MMS. This further reduced the capacity to send images and their maximum sizes upon delivery across the initial 7 years.</p>

<p>Messages in iCloud fixes this problem locally for iOS devices. However, any Mac with iCloud sync enabled will try to fill the drive with sometimes hundreds of gigabytes of messages + attachments. It will even regenerate the attachments folder entirely if you delete it. The messages are also unsearchable if they aren't locally present, regardless of platform.</p>

<p>I think it might be time to at least consider 2, 3, and 5 year options. It might also be time to consider detaching "keep text only" from "keep attachments" in this selection, as well.</p>
