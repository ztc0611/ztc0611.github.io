From 2007-2014, the default and only retention option for iPhone texts was "Forever." This changed with iOS 8, released September 2014.[^[How to Delete Your Message History Automatically (2014)](https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/delete-your-message-history-automatically-0157422/)] At that point the automatic cleanup options were functionally 30 days, 1 year, or 7 years.

Today, this option is 30 days, 1 year, or 18.5 years. Since 2014, photos have gotten a lot larger, as have videos. iMessage will perform *some* size mitigation depending on context[^Videos will be compressed to a lower resolution depending on length/size. Sometimes videos get embarrassingly blurry as they approach 1 minute. ProRAW will send as a much smaller JPEG.], however it doesn't touch standard HEIC/JPEG images. 

The iPhone (2007, "2G") took photos between 400 and 800KB, and at launch didn't even support MMS.[^This came in 2009, and photos were also heavily compressed in comparison to what came later with iMessage. (Capped at 500KB or less typically.)] A modern standard iPhone photo is frequently in the 3-6MB range. Across that time, directly sharing pictures also moved from being the realm of email/flash drives/DVDs to the realm of texting.

iMessage itself had only existed for 3 years in 2014, any messages before that were only "green bubble" SMS/MMS. This further reduced the capacity to send images and their maximum sizes upon delivery across the initial 7 years.

Messages in iCloud fixes this problem locally for iOS devices. However, any Mac with iCloud sync enabled will try to fill the drive with sometimes hundreds of gigabytes of messages + attachments. It will even regenerate the attachments folder entirely if you delete it. The messages are also unsearchable if they aren't locally present, regardless of platform.

I think it might be time to at least consider 2, 3, and 5 year options. It might also be time to consider detaching "keep text only" from "keep attachments" in this selection, as well.
